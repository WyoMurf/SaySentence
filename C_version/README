This directory contains the beginnings of a translation of the java SaySentence Engine into C.
I will be using Sable (It can generate both Java and C). Hopefully, when all is finished,
the sable stuff will generate .c and .h files that can be used to create the engine (parser+interpreter)
that composes the saysentence/sayscript mechanism.

It's quite raw and young and totally and unnervingly incomplete.

TODO:

convert all the actions in the .g files to C from Java. Should be real easy (pardon my sarcasm).
  -- don't forget to introduce memory allocation/destruction code!

flesh out the C structures to match the classes. It might be nice to preserve the naming.
