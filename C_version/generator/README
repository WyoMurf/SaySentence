This is how I'm going to build the api code for SaySentence in C. I'm going to generate it.
I'm using gsl for this. See (https://github.com/imatix/gsl).

I have a set of xml "model" files for each structure built. I'm planning on using 
the hashtab from Asterisk, and MAYBE the DLL implementation from there as well.

It's about 2/3 done. I've fleshed in most things, but the hash stuff needs
a bit more work. The objlists need some also.

GSL has a pretty good tutorial associated with it, but... for actual code generation
you might find this project a much better example, as there are common things you'll
need to do (like find who mentions your struct, or what structs you mention, 
how to read in files with xml suffixes, and such like). GSL has some quirks,
like not liking tabs in some places, very sparse documentation of the helper functions,
and such like, but my little project here demonstrates that it is fully capable of
doing the job.

When I'm done, all this will move up a directory, and be a lot cleaner.
